## System Architecture

The NudgeSpark system is designed using a modular architecture that includes the following key components:

- **Mobile App**: Developed with React Native for both iOS and Android platforms.
- **Backend API**: Powered by FeathersJS, providing a real-time and RESTful API.
- **Database**: A relational database (e.g., PostgreSQL) to store user data, nudges, and other relevant information.
- **Authentication**: Implemented using Google Sign-In for seamless user authentication.
- **Real-time Communication**: Enabled by a custom WebSocket server for real-time chat functionality.
- **Notifications**: Push notifications to keep users engaged with timely nudges and updates.
